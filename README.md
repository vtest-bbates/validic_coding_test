# Validic Coding Test
## Practical Problem

The problem:

Please write an Android app in Kotlin, or an iOS app in Swift (depending on the position you are applying for) that uses the [Github Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api) to help show programming language trends across the following cities:

- Boston
- San Francisco
- Los Angeles
- Denver
- Boulder
- Chicago
- New York

Program guidelines:
- all work done in a git repository
- unit tests

The app should show a list with the following information:

```

Boston:
  - Python: 25%
  - Ruby: 10%
  - C++: 10%
  - C:  5%
San Francisco:
  - Node: 35%
  - Scala: 10%
  - Ruby: 15%

```

That can be read as "In Boston, 25% of all current programming jobs are for Python"

The numbers above are made up but your program should be able to give us some indication of programming language trends across those cities.


### Please fork this repo.  Working from the 'backend' branch, please add your code and then perform a pull request.  Once we have your code, please remove your fork from public view or delete it entirely.
### Please include a ANSWERS.MD file in your repo that includes answers and thoughts to the following:
- challenges you ran into
- areas of the code you are most proud of
- areas of the code you are least proud of
- tradeoffs you were forced to make
- changes required to be production ready

This exercise should take you no more than 6 hours, if it does please just commit your work and send it over.
